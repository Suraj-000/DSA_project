It is required to analyse the fruit vendor shop using AVL tree and hashing and linked lists.
The AVL tree is balanced based of the price of fruit and each fruit has a hashkey associated with it.
Using hashkey we can find the fruit details in O(1).
One more feature of this code is that it takes input the amount the customer has and returns the list
maximum number of fruits the customer can buy.
